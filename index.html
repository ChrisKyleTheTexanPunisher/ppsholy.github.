        <h1>IMPORTANT MESSAGE</h1>
        
        <p>Hey all, Unfortunatly i have to shut down PPSHoly for a little while.</p>
        <p>This is due to personal issues that i wont speak on, but also because</p>
        <p>the school is hot on my tail and i don't want to get suspended. It was</p>
        <p>nice well it lasted but for the time being i have to focus on me and school.</p>
        <p><a href="https://ppstv.netlify.app">SkoolTV<a> will stay up for the time being but if it gets blocked then i won't be rehosting it</p>
        <p>if it does get blocked you can rehost it here:</p>
        <a style="text-align:center;"target="_self" href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IcyonGit/SkoolTV"><img alt="Deploy to Netlify" src="css/netlify.svg"></a>
        <p>I may come back in the future but it's not likley.</p>
